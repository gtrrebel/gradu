\chapter{Pick-Nevanlinna functions}

Pick-Nevanlinna function is an analytic function defined in upper half-plane with a non-negative real part. Such functions are sometimes also called Herglotz or $\R$ but we will often call them just Pick functions. The class of Pick functions is denoted by $P$.

Pick functions have many interesting properties related to positive matrices and that is why they are central objects to the theory of matrix monotone functions.

\section{Basic properties and examples}

Most obvious examples of Pick functions might be functions of the form $\alpha x + \beta$ where $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ and $\alpha \geq 0$. Of course one could also take $\beta \in \Hpc$.

Sum of two Pick functions is a Pick function and one can multiply a Pick function by non-negative constant to get a new Pick function.
