\chapter{Pick-Nevanlinna functions}

\textit{Pick-Nevanlinna function} is an analytic function defined in upper half-plane with a non-negative real part. Such functions are sometimes also called Herglotz or $\R$ functions but we will call them just \textit{Pick functions}. The class of Pick functions is denoted by $\pickclass$.

Pick functions have many interesting properties related to positive matrices and that is why they are central objects to the theory of matrix monotone functions.

\section{Basic properties and examples}

Most obvious examples of Pick functions might be functions of the form $\alpha z + \beta$ where $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ and $\alpha \geq 0$. Of course one could also take $\beta \in \Hpc$. Actually real constants are the only Pick functions failing to map $\Hp \to \Hp$: non-constant analytic functions are open mappings.

Sum of two Pick functions is a Pick function and one can multiply a Pick function by non-negative constant to get a new Pick function. Same is true for composition.

The map $z \mapsto -\frac{1}{z}$ is evidently a Pick function. Hence are also all functions of the form
\[
	\alpha z + \beta + \sum_{i = 1}^{N} \frac{m_{i}}{\lambda_{i}- z},
\]
where $N$ is non-negative integer, $\alpha, m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{N} \geq 0$, $\beta \in \Hp$ and $\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{N} \in \Hp$. So far we have constructed our function by adding simple poles to the closure of lower half-plane. We could further add poles of higher order at lower half plane, and change residues and so on, but then we have to be a bit more careful.

There are (luckily) more interesting examples: all the functions of the form $x^{p}$ where $0 < p < 1$ are Pick functions. To be precise, one should choose branch for the previous so that they are real at positive real axis. Also $\log$ yields Pick function when branch is chosen properly i.e. naturally again. Another classic example is $\tan$. Indeed, by the addition formula
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\tan(x + i y) &=& \frac{\tan(x) + \tan(i y)}{1 - \tan(x) \tan(i y)} = \frac{\tan(x) + i \tanh(y)}{1 - i \tan(x) \tanh(y)} \\
	&=& \frac{\tan(x)(1 + \tanh^2(y))}{1 + \tan^2(x) \tanh^2(y)} + i \frac{(1 + \tan^2(x))\tanh(y)}{1 + \tan^2(x) \tanh^2(y)},
\end{eqnarray*}
and $y$ and $\tanh(y)$ have the same sign.

We observe the following useful fact.

\begin{prop}
	If $(\varphi_{i})_{i = 1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of Pick functions converging locally uniformly, the limit function is also a Pick function.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Locally uniform limits of analytic functions are analytic. Also the limit function has evidently non-negative imaginary part.
\end{proof}

This is one of the main reasons we include real constants to Pick functions, although they are exceptional in many ways. Note that for any $z \in \Hp$ we have $\log(z) = \lim_{p \to 0^{+}}(z^p - 1)/p$: $\log$ can be understood as a limit of Pick functions. There's actually a considerable strengthening of the previous result.

There's a considerable strengthening of the previous result.

\begin{prop}
	If $(\varphi_{i})_{i = 1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of Pick functions converging pointwise, the limit function is also a Pick function.
\end{prop}

We will not prove this quite surprising result yet; the message is that the class of Pick functions is very rigid in some sense.

\section{Rigidity}

\subsection{Schur functions}

To understand the rigidity phenomena we take look at the close relative to Pick functions, \textit{Schur functions}. Schur funtions are analytic maps from open unit disc to closed unit disc. These functions functions include for instance power functions $z \mapsto z^{n}$ and more generally, as one may check, any Blaschke products, that is products of the terms of the form
\[
	\rho_{a, \omega}(z) = \omega \frac{a - z}{1 - \overline{a} z},
\]
Blaschke factors. Classic fact about these functions is the Schwarz lemma.

\begin{lause}[Schwarz lemma]
	Let $\psi : \D \to \D$ be analytic such that $\psi(0) = 0$. Then $|\psi(z)| \leq |z|$ for any $z \in \D$ and hence also $|\psi'(0)| \leq 1$. If $|\psi(z)| = |z|$ for some $z \in \D \setminus \{0\}$ or $|\psi'(0)| = 1$, $\psi(z) = \omega z$ for some $\omega \in \mathbb{S}$.
\end{lause}

Fixing value of Schur function at $0$ restricts function a whole lot.

The usual proof is by cleverly using maximum modulus principle for $\psi(z)/z$. Maximum modulus principle itself is consequence of the Cauchy's integral formula. There's also more symmetric form for Schwarz lemma, called Schwarz-Pick theorem.

\begin{lause}[Schwarz-Pick theorem]
	Let $\psi : \D \to \D$ be analytic. Then for any $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \D$ we have
	\[
		\left|\frac{\psi(z_{1}) - \psi(z_{2})}{1 - \overline{\psi(z_{1})} \psi(z_{2})} \right| \leq \left|\frac{z_{1} - z_{2}}{1 - \overline{z_{1}}z_{2}}\right|,
	\]
	and
	\[
		\frac{\left|\psi'(z_{1})\right|}{1 - |\psi(z_{1})|^2} \leq \frac{1}{1 - |z_{1}|^2}.
	\]
	If the equality holds in one of the inequalities, $\psi$ is an Blaschke factor.
\end{lause}

Note that one obtains the usual Schwarz lemma if $z_{1} = 0 = \psi(z_{1})$. One may check that if $\psi$ is Blaschke factor, the inequalities hold as equalities.
\begin{proof}
	Consider the map $\psi_{1} = \rho_{\psi(z_{1})} \circ \psi \circ \rho_{z_{1}}$. The claim follows by using the previous form of the Schwarz lemma for the $\psi_{1}$ and point $z_{2}$.
\end{proof}

The previous result shows that Blaschke factors are exactly the analytic bijections $\D \to \D$.

One can also make weaker estimates straight from Cauchy's integral formula. We can for instance write
\[
	\psi(a) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\gamma} \frac{\psi(z)}{z - a} dz
\]
for suitable $\gamma$. Now if $\psi$ extends over unit circle, letting $\gamma$ trace unit circle we have
\[
	|\psi(a)| \leq \left(\max_{|z| = 1} \left|\psi(z)\right| \right) \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_{0}^{2 \pi} \frac{d t}{|e^{i t}  - a|}.
\]
This is not very strong estimate; the averaged integral tends to infinity as $|a| \to 1$, but the point is that by a simple argument we have can some bound on analytic function on a disc given only bound on its boundary values.

The point in looking at Schur functions is that we can directly bring the claims for Schur functions to Pick functions with maps
\begin{align*}
	\toplane : \D \to \Hp & \hspace{1cm} \toplane (z) = i \frac{1 - z}{1 + z} \\
	\tocircle : \Hp \to \D & \hspace{1cm} \tocircle (z) = \frac{i - z}{i + z}.
\end{align*}
If $\psi$ is Schur function then $\toplane \circ \psi \circ \tocircle$ is a Pick function, and conversely every Pick function $\varphi$ gives rise to Schur function $\tocircle \circ \varphi \circ \toplane$. We can directly translate Schwarz-Pick theorem to Pick functions.

\begin{lause}[Schwarz-Pick theorem for the upper half-plane]
	Let $\varphi : \Hp \to \Hp$ be analytic. Then for any $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \Hp$ we have
	\[
		\left|\frac{\varphi(z_{1}) - \varphi(z_{2})}{\varphi(z_{1}) - \overline{\varphi(z_{2})}} \right| \leq \left|\frac{z_{1} - z_{2}}{z_{1} - \overline{z_{2}}} \right|.
	\]
\end{lause}

Correspondingly analytic bijections in $\pickclass$ are exactly function of the form
\[
	z \mapsto \frac{a z + b}{c z + d},
\]
where $a, b, c, d \in \R$ and $a d - b c > 0$. Among these mapping the map
\[
	f : z \mapsto \frac{z \Re(w_{0}) - (|w_{0}|^2 + \Im(w_{0}))}{(1 + \Im(w_{0})) z - \Re(w_{0}))}
\]
satisfies $f(i) = w_{0}$.

\subsection{Pick matrices}

We can also arrive at the previous estimate directly using Cauchy's integral theorem, a bit similarly as with unit disc. Assume first that $\varphi$ is a bounded Pick-function extending over real line. We can start by proving that if $\varphi$ has positive imaginary part on real line, then it has positive real part on whole upper half-plane The idea to consider
\begin{align*}
	\varphi(a) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{\gamma} \frac{\varphi(z)}{z - a} dz,
\end{align*}
again for suitable closed curve $\gamma$. If $\varphi$ decays fast enough at infinitity, we can deform the contour $\gamma$ to coincide with real axis. The unfortunate thing is that the we can't say much about the real or imaginary part of $ \frac{\varphi(z)}{z - a}$. But there's a trick: we can fix our problem by considering
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\varphi(z)}{(z - a) (z - \overline{a})} dz.
\end{align*}
This expression has positive real part, and by using the residue theorem, the real part equals
\[
	\frac{\varphi(a) - \overline{\varphi(a)}}{a - \overline{a}},
\]
hence the claim. Also boundedness is enough for this estimate.

To arrive at Schwarz-Pick theorem consider integral
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varphi(z) \left(\frac{c_{1}}{z - z_{1}} + \frac{c_{2}}{z - z_{2}} \right) \left(\frac{\overline{c_{1}}}{z - \overline{z_{1}}} + \frac{\overline{c_{2}}}{z - \overline{z_{2}}} \right) dz.
\end{align*}
Again, the point is that writing $h(z) = \frac{c_{1}}{z - z_{1}} + \frac{c_{2}}{z - z_{2}}$, $h$ is meromorphic in upper half-plane expect for the simple poles at $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, thus giving information about $\varphi(z_{1})$ and $\varphi(z_{2})$, $\overline{h(\overline{z})}$ is analytic in the upper halfplane and $h(z)\overline{h(\overline{z})}$ is real on the real axis.

Now this expression should have positive real part for any $c_{1}, c_{2} \in \C$, and computing the real part using the residue theorem, we arrive at
\begin{align*}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} |c_{1}|^{2} &+ [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} c_{1} \overline{c_{2}} \\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} c_{2} \overline{c_{1}} &+ [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} |c_{2}|^{2},
\end{align*}
where we abuse the notation a little by writing $\varphi(\overline{z}) = \overline{\varphi(z)}$.

But this is to say that the matrix
\begin{align*}
	\left([z_{i}, \overline{z_{j}}]_{\varphi}\right)_{1 \leq i, j \leq 2} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
is positive. Now, it just so turns out that ``determinant of the matrix is non-negative" is equivalent to Schwarz-Pick theorem.

It is not very hard to generalize the previous argument larger matrices, and we have arrived to
\begin{lause}\label{pick-nevanlinna_theorem}
	If $\varphi$ is Pick function and $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n}$ are any points in the upper half-plane, then the matrix
	\begin{align}\label{Pick_matrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		[z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{n}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{n}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align}
	is positive.
\end{lause}

The matrix \ref{Pick_matrix} is called \textit{Pick matrix}.

\begin{proof}
	We have already proved the theorem in the case that $\varphi$ is bounded and extends analytically over the real line. For general case consider the sequence $g_{n}$ of Pick functions given by
	\[
		g_{n}(z) = \frac{(1 - \frac{1}{n})x + \frac{i}{n}}{(1 - \frac{1}{n}) - i\frac{x}{n}} = \toplane \circ \left(z \mapsto \left(1 - \frac{2}{n}\right)z\right) \circ \tocircle.
	\]
	Now
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $g_{n}(z) \to z$ pointwise.
		\item $g_{n}$'s extend analytically over real line and $g_{n}(\overline{\H_{+}})$ is compact subset of $\H_{+}$ for every $n \geq 1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	It follows $\varphi \circ g_{n} \to \varphi$ pointwise and $\varphi \circ g_{n}$'s satisfy the already proven case. Finally, also the corresponding Pick-matrices of $\varphi \circ g_{n}$'s converge to Pick matrix of $\varphi$, hence the general case.
\end{proof}

\section{Weak characterization}

Theorem \ref{pick-nevanlinna_theorem} has a converse.

\begin{lause}\label{pick-nevalinna_converse}
	If $\varphi : \Hp \to \Hpc$ such that for any $n \geq 1$ and $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n} \in \Hp$ the respective Pick matrix
	\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		[z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{n}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{n}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	is positive, then $\varphi$ is a Pick function.
\end{lause}

Note that if all the Pick matrices are positive, function clearly has non-negative imaginary part. Thus we ``only" need to verify analyticity.

Let's first check continuity. For this we only need positivity on $2 \times 2$-matrices.

\begin{lause}
	Let $A \subset \Hp$ and $\varphi : A \to \Hpc$ such that for any $z_{1}, z_{2} \in \Hp$ Pick matrix
	\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	is positive. Then $f$ is locally Lipschitz, in particular continuity.
\end{lause}
\begin{proof}
	TODO
\end{proof}

Curiosly enough, $\varphi$ is analytic as long as all its $3 \times 3$ Pick matrices are positive. This result is known as Hindmarsh's theorem.

\begin{lause}\label{Hindmarsh_theorem}
	Let $U \subset \Hp$ be open and $\varphi : U \to \Hpc$ such that for every $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3} \in \Hp$ Pick matrix
	\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{3}}]_{\varphi}\\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{3}}]_{\varphi}\\
		[z_{3}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{3}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{3}, \overline{z_{3}}]_{\varphi}\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	is positive. Then $f$ is analytic.
\end{lause}
\begin{proof}
	TODO
\end{proof}

As an immediate corollary we get theorem \ref{pick-nevalinna_converse}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem \ref{pick-nevalinna_converse}]
\end{proof}

One might now argue that one does not need Pick matrices larger than $3 \times 3$ to talk about Pick functions. They however carry interesting ``global" information.

\begin{lause}
	Let $U \subset \Hp$ be open and $\varphi : U \to \Hpc$ such that for any $n \geq 1$ and $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n} \in U$ the respective Pick matrix
	\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		[z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{n}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{n}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	is positive. Then $\varphi$ is a restriction of an unique Pick function.
\end{lause}

This tells us that we may recognise Pick functions from local information. To prove the theorem, we first introduce the notion of \textit{Pick point}.

\begin{maar}
	Let $U \subset \Hp$ be open and $\varphi : U \to \Hpc$. We say that $z \in U$ is Pick point of $\varphi$, if $\varphi$ is analytic at $z$ and the $n \times n$ matrix
	\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[z, \overline{z}]_{\varphi} & [z, \overline{z}, \overline{z} ]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z, \overline{z}, \overline{z}, \ldots, \overline{z}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z, z \overline{z}]_{\varphi} & [z, z, \overline{z}, \overline{z} ]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z, z, \overline{z}, \overline{z}, \ldots, \overline{z}]_{\varphi} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		[z, z, \ldots, z, \overline{z}]_{\varphi} & [z, z, \ldots, z, \overline{z}, \overline{z} ]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z, z, \ldots, z, \overline{z}, \overline{z}, \ldots, \overline{z}]_{\varphi} \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align*}
	is positive for every $n$.
\end{maar}

Where does this definition come from? The idea is to answer the question: what does it mean the Pick matrices to be non-negative at a single point, say $z_{0}$? In the definition of Pick matrix we could let all the variables be equal and conclude that the matrix
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} \\
	[z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	[z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
is positive, but this would only tell us that $[z_{0}, \overline{z_{0}}]_{\varphi}$ is non-negative. We need derivatives.

The idea is to $*$-conjugate the Pick matrix first. Say $n = 2$. If we subtract first row from the second in the Pick matrix
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
we get
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} - [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} - [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	(z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & (z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Now subtracting first column from the second results in
\begin{align*}
&\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} - [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi}\\
	(z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & (z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} - (z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix} \\
=&
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & \overline{(z_{2} - z_{1})}[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	(z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & (z_{2} - z_{1}) \overline{(z_{2} - z_{1})}[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align*}
In the language of matrices this really says that
\begin{align*}
&\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	-1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & -1 \\
	0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \\
= &
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & \overline{(z_{2} - z_{1})}[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	(z_{2} - z_{1})[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & (z_{2} - z_{1}) \overline{(z_{2} - z_{1})}[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix} \\
= &
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & (z_{2} - z_{1})
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & \overline{(z_{2} - z_{1})}
\end{bmatrix}:
\end{align*}
Matrices
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\text{ and }
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}\\
	[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
are congruent.

Generalizing this argument we see that the matrices
\begin{gather*}
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
	[z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{2}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	[z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{n}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{n}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\text{ and } \\
\begin{bmatrix}
	[z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}, \ldots, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
	[z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, z_{2}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}, \ldots, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	[z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}, \overline{z_{2}}, \ldots, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}
are congruent. We hence conclude the following.

\begin{lem}
	Let $U \subset \Hp$ be open and $\varphi : U \to \Hpc$. Let $z_{0} \in U$. Assume that for some $r > 0$, for every $n \geq 1$ and $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n} \in \D(z_{0}, r) \cap U$ the respective Pick matrix is positive. Then $z_{0}$ is Pick point of $\varphi$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	By theorem \ref{Hindmarsh_theorem} $\varphi$ is analytic at $z_{0}$. By previous observation all the matrices of the form

are positive. By letting $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n} \to z_{0}$ we get the claim.
\end{proof}
Matrix \ref{extended_dobsch_matrix} is called \textit{extended Pick matrix}.




\section{Pick-Nevanlinna Interpolation theorem}

There's another way to think about Schwarz lemma: if $\psi$ is Schur function such that $\psi(0) = 0$, then also $\psi(z)/z$ is a Schur function. One may again translate this to Pick functions, and get an interesting corollary: if $\varphi$ is a Pick function such that $\varphi(i) = i$, then also
\[
	\frac{\varphi(z) - z}{1 + z \varphi(z)}
\]
is a Pick function. Actually, this gives a bijection between Pick functions and Pick functions with $\varphi(i) = i \ldots$ almost: $z \mapsto -\frac{1}{z}$ would like to map to constant infinity.

We could form similar bijection for any pair $(z, w) \in \H_{+}^{2}$: Pick functions for which $\varphi(z) = w$.

The previous bijection translates nicely to Pick matrices. Take sequence of points $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n} \in \H_{+} \setminus \{i\}$. Theorem \ref{pick-nevanlinna_theorem} for $\varphi$ and points $i, z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}$ implies that the matrix
\begin{align*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		[i, -i]_{\varphi} & [i, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [i, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		[z_{1}, -i]_{\varphi} & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots & [z_{1}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		[z_{n}, -i]_{\varphi} & [z_{n}, \overline{z_{1}}]_{\varphi} & \cdots &  [z_{n}, \overline{z_{n}}]_{\varphi}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
is positive. Since $[i, -i]_{\varphi} = 1$ is positive, taking Schur-complement with respect to upper-left corner this is equivalent to the matrix
\begin{align*}
	& \left([z_{i}, \overline{z_{j}}]_{\varphi} - [z_{i}, -i]_{\varphi}[i, \overline{z_{j}}]_{\varphi}\right)_{1 \leq i, j \leq n} \\
	=& \left(\left(\frac{\varphi(z_{i})- \overline{\varphi(z_{j})}}{z_{i} - \overline{z_{j}}}\right) - \left(\frac{\varphi(z_{i}) + i}{z_{i} + i}\right)\left(\frac{i - \overline{\varphi(z_{j})}}{i - \overline{z_{j}}}\right)\right)_{1 \leq i, j \leq n} \\
	=& \left(\frac{[z_{i}, \overline{z_{j}}]_{\varphi} (z_{i} \overline{z_{j}} + 1) - 1 - \varphi(z_{i}) \overline{\varphi(z_{j})}}{(z_{i} + i) (\overline{z_{j}} - i)}\right)_{1 \leq i, j \leq n}
\end{align*}
being positive. But if one applies the theorem to the function $\frac{\varphi(z) - z}{1 + z \varphi(z)}$ and points $z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots, z_{n}$, one arrives at the matrix
\begin{align*}
	\left(\frac{[z_{i}, \overline{z_{j}}]_{\varphi} (z_{i} \overline{z_{j}} + 1) - 1 - \varphi(z_{i}) \overline{\varphi(z_{j})}}{(1 + z_{i} \varphi(z_{i}))(1 + \overline{z_{j}} \overline{\varphi(z_{j})})}\right)_{1 \leq i, j \leq n}.
\end{align*}
Two resulting matrices are evidently congruent. TODO

Carrying on with this line of thinking we arrive at a surprising conclusing.

\begin{lause}[Pick-Nevanlinna interpolation theorem]
	Let $(z_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ and $(w_{i})_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ be two sequences of points in $\H_{+}$. Then there exists a Pick function $\varphi$ such that $\varphi(z_{i}) = w_{i}$, if and only if the matrix
	\[
		\begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{w_{1} - \overline{w_{1}}}{z_{1} - \overline{z_{1}}} & \frac{w_{1} - \overline{w_{2}}}{z_{1} - \overline{z_{2}}} & \cdots & \frac{w_{1} - \overline{w_{n}}}{z_{1} - \overline{z_{n}}} \\
		\frac{w_{2} - \overline{w_{1}}}{z_{2} - \overline{z_{1}}} & \frac{w_{2} - \overline{w_{2}}}{z_{2} - \overline{z_{2}}} & \cdots & \frac{w_{2} - \overline{w_{n}}}{z_{2} - \overline{z_{n}}} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		\frac{w_{n} - \overline{w_{1}}}{z_{n} - \overline{z_{1}}} & \frac{w_{n} - \overline{w_{2}}}{z_{n} - \overline{z_{2}}} & \cdots &  \frac{w_{n} - \overline{w_{n}}}{z_{n} - \overline{z_{n}}}
		\end{bmatrix}
	\]
	is positive.
\end{lause}

\begin{proof}
	One direction is the theorem \ref{pick-nevanlinna_theorem}. For the other direction we proceed by induction. If $z_{1} = i = w_{1}$, we just noted that this matrix being positive is equivalent to smaller matrix, namely
	\[
		\left(\frac{\frac{w_{i} - z_{i}}{1 + z_{i} w_{i}} - \frac{\overline{w_{i}} - \overline{z_{i}}}{1 + \overline{z_{i}} \overline{w_{i}}}}{z_{i} - \overline{z_{j}}}\right)_{2 \leq i, j \leq n}
	\]
	being positive. By inductive hypothesis this then means that there exists a Pick function $\tilde{\varphi}$ with $\tilde{\varphi}(z_{i}) = \frac{w_{i} - z_{i}}{1 + z_{i} w_{i}}$. But then $\varphi(z) = \frac{\tilde{\varphi}(z) + z}{1 - z \tilde{\varphi}(z)}$ fits the bill. TODO: general case (introduce Schur transform)
