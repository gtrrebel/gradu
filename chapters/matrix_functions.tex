	\item How to extend functions $f : (a, b)^2 \to \R^{2}$ to a matrix function taking two entries? What is $f(A, B)$? If $A$ and $B$ commute, there exists $h_{A}, h_{B} : \R \to (a, b)$, $C \in \H$ such that $h_{A}(C) = A$ and $h_{B}(C) = B$ and we should hence define $f(A, B) = f(h_{A}(C), h_{B}(C))$. What about the general case?
